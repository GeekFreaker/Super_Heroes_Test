# Super_Heroes_Test
An app that consumes the super heroes API

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN :)

## SuperHero App.
---

Build a native Android app in Kotlin that utilises the SuperHero API https://superheroapi.com/).

# Feature Set
Based on the documentation (https://superheroapi.com/index.html) it is up to you to determine both
the feature set and corresponding UI that will best sell this product.

# Android Version
- [x] targetSdkVersion 29( latest version )
- [X] minSdkVersion 18 

# Frameworks
Whilst we donâ€™t enforce the use of the following frameworks, those are currently utilised in the
products that you will be working on, when your application is successful.
- [x] Networking: Retrofit
- [x] Image Caching and Downloading: Glide

# Architecture
We envision that the app will have a Modular Workspace.
- [x] 1. SuperHero Project
- [ ] 2. UI ( Have at least one Dynamic Feature Module)
- [x] 3. Networking DONE
- [x] 4. Logs DONE

# Other Considerations
- [x] 1. Custom Font
- [ ] 2. Support tablet view and landscape
- [x] 3. Localisation

## Additions Commentary
----
- [x] I've adde comments to the code where possible
- [ ] I took a look at Room it looks like it needs me to knuckle down
      it reminds me of EloquentORM in Laravel a bit, It needs time.
- When issuing a test or assessment like this in future please allocated
  an expected turn around time just so we candidate have an ETA.
- Compared to asyncTask retrofit is awesome.
- [x] I also took the time to add a GlideSlider
- [x] I've learned a few tricks from you thanks again for the opportunity.

- ANother thing the API(superheroes.com) doesn't actually work it gave errors
  fortunately I found a way around all that, the BASE_URL explains all. :)
  
  Thanks Again.
